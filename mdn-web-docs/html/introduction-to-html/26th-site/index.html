      There once was a man named O'Dell<br />
      Who loved to write HTML<br />
      But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br />
      and his markup didn't read very well.

      Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but
      determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and prepared to do
      battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.

      Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and
      pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted
      distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it
      hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.
