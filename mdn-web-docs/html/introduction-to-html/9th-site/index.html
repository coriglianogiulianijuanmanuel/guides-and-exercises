    <h1>Important notice</h1>
    <p>

      spotted stealing <strong><em>several</em> garden gnomes</strong> from a
      shopping center in downtown <strong>Milwaukee</strong>. They were all
      wearing <em>green jumpsuits</em> and <em>silly hats</em>, and seemed to be
      having a whale of a time. If anyone has <strong>any</strong> information
      about this incident, please contact the police <strong>now</strong>.
