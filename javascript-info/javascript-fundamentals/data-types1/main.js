// We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number:

let message = "hello";
message = 123;
// Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.
