// Using for polyfills

// We use the global object to test for support of modern language features.

// For instance, test if a built-in Promise object exists (it doesn’t in really old browsers):
if (!window.Promise) {
  alert("Your browser is really old!");
}

// If there’s none (say, we’re in an old browser), we can create “polyfills”: add functions that are not supported by the environment, but exist in the modern standard.
