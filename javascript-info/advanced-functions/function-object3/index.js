// Custom properties

// We can also add properties of our own.
// Here we add the counter property to track the total calls count:
function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hi!");

  // let's count how many times we run
  sayHi.counter++;
}

sayHi.counter = 0; // initial value

sayHi(); // Hi!
sayHi(); // Hi!

console.log(sayHi.counter); // 2

/* 
A property is not a variable

A property assigned to a function like sayHi.counter = 0 does not define a local variable counter inside it. In other words, a property counter and a variable let counter are two unrelated things.

We can treat a function as an object, store properties in it, but that has no effect on its execution. Variables are not function properties and vice versa. These are just parallel worlds.
*/

// Function properties can replace closures sometimes. For instance, we can rewrite the counter function example from the chapter Variable scope, closure to use a function property:
function makeCounter() {
  // instead of:
  // let count = 0

  function counter() {
    return counter.count++;
  }

  counter.count = 0;

  return counter;
}

let counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 0
console.log(counter()); // 1
// The count is now stored in the function directly, not in its outer Lexical Environment.

// Is it better or worse than using a closure?
// The main difference is that if the value of count lives in an outer variable, then external code is unable to access it. Only nested functions may modify it. And if itâ€™s bound to a function, then such a thing is possible:
counter.count = 10;
console.log(counter()); // 10
// So the choice of implementation depends on our aims.
