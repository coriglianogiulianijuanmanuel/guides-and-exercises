// WeakSet
// It is analogous to Set, but we may only add objects to WeakSet (not primitives).
// An object exists in the set while it is reachable from somewhere else.
// Like Set, it supports add, has and delete, but not size, keys() and no iterations.

// Being “weak”, it also serves as additional storage. But not for arbitrary data, rather for “yes/no” facts. A membership in WeakSet may mean something about the object.

// For instance, we can add users to WeakSet to keep track of those who visited our site:
let visitedSet = new WeakSet();

let john = { name: "John" };
let pete = { name: "Pete" };
let mary = { name: "Mary" };

visitedSet.add(john); // John visited us
visitedSet.add(pete); // Then Pete
visitedSet.add(john); // John again

// visitedSet has 2 users now

// check if John visited?
console.log(visitedSet.has(john)); // true

// check if Mary visited?
console.log(visitedSet.has(mary)); // false

john = null;

// visitedSet will be cleaned automatically

// The most notable limitation of WeakMap and WeakSet is the absence of iterations, and the inability to get all current content. That may appear inconvenient, but does not prevent WeakMap/WeakSet from doing their main job – be an “additional” storage of data for objects which are stored/managed at another place.
